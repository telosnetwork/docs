# Overview

In this section we are going to cover the following topics:&#x20;

1. [Introduction to tEVM](introduction-to-tevm.md) and its [architecture](../about-ethereum-virtual-machine/overview-and-architecture.md)
2. [Benefits of Telos](../about-ethereum-virtual-machine/comparing-telos-to-other-evm-chains.md)
3. [Block production, validation, transaction fees (Telos native and tEVM) and consensus](comparing-telos-to-other-evm-chains-1.md)
4. [On-chain governance](comparing-telos-to-other-evm-chains-2.md)
5. tEVM [Gas fees](../about-ethereum-virtual-machine/gas-fees.md)
6. [How to desposit, withdraw and send TLOS](deposit-withdraw-and-send-tlos.md)
7. [Using dapps on the tEVM](using-dapps-on-the-tevm.md)

This section is mainly intended for developers who are working with Solidity to bring their smart contracts onto Telos.

Since Telos EVM (tEVM) is an EVM running as a smart contracts on the Telos blockchain network, it makes it easy to bring existing Solidity applications to Telos. This enables developers to adopt Telos blockchain with it's advanced features, like fair distribution, fast block times and cost-efficient transactions for any EVM based dApp.
