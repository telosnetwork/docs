# Introduction to tEVM

Decentralization is the key when it comes to Blockchain technology. One of the main components driving the adoption and implementation of blockchain technology is Virtual Machines (VM).

VMs are machines that attempt a higher level of abstraction than current operating systems like Windows, macOS, or Linux. VMs are created on top of the host operating system so that they can function in a similar way to a physical computing machine.

VMs approximate the computing power of physical machines using virtual architectures. This enables VMs to run on many different types of OS's and hardware, making them the perfect engine for a decentralized ecosystem. Through a VM, one can use the available computing resources of participating nodes in the network regardless of your physical location or geograpical area.

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) acts like a global prosessing unit or computer which is formed by the collective computing power of its network nodes, making the EVM accessable from anywhere in the world. These nodes lend their resources to developers to create smart contracts and decentralised apps (dapps) which relies on blockchain.&#x20;

Due to the popularity of Ethereum, EVM and its programming languages (Solidity and Vyper) are the dominant smart contract execution and development environments. However, networks such as Ethereum have become near unusable for the average user, with slow transaction times and excessive transaction fees.&#x20;

Telos EVM (tEVM) is an EVM running on a Telos blockchain. This allows for Ethereum based dapps to easily deploy on the Telos blockchain with all the benefits of Telos, such as

* no front-running,&#x20;
* faster transaction speeds,&#x20;
* and low transaction fees.&#x20;

For an in-depth comparison between the Telos EVM and other EVM based chains see the [Benefits of Telos compared to EVM chains](../about-ethereum-virtual-machine/comparing-telos-to-other-evm-chains.md).

These documents will guide native Telos users, as well as users coming from Ethereum, to get started on the tEVM.

For a more technical overview of the EVM, navigate to the [About tEVM](../about-ethereum-virtual-machine/) section.

Developers looking to start deploying on the tEVM, can find support in the [Developer Guides](../developer-guides/).
