  managment of Telos EVM local, testnet and mainnet nodes.

# Telos EVM Controller

#### COMING SOON!

### Requirements

* `git`
* `docker`
* `python3`

### Quickstart

Thanks to Teo from TelosKoreaBP for this quick rundown:

```
## Need installed python version >= python 3.7
## Requires root at the moment.

git clone https://github.com/telosnetwork/telos-evm-docker.git
cd telos-evm-docker

apt-get update && apt-get install python3-venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

## from now on we are working in the virtual environment.
## just run 'deactivate' when you want to deactivate virtual environment.

pip install pip --upgrade
pip install -U --no-cache-dir -e . -r requirements.txt

tevmc init testnet
cd testnet

## Modify tevmc.json
## For mainnet, signer_account, signer_permission, signer_key
## Containers use ports of host machine so you need to check the ports if used already.
tevmc build --headless
tevmc up

# Start process to backup logs
tail -f tevmc.log > backup.tevmc.log &

## Wait until nodeos synced and hyperion-api activated.
## To stop:
tevmc down
```

### Installation

`tevmc` is a [python installable package](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html), and its currently [available on github](https://github.com/telosnetwork/telos-evm-docker).&#x20;

1. `git clone git@github.com:telosnetwork/telos-evm-docker.git`&#x20;
2. `cd telos-evm-docker`
3. `git checkout python_toolchain`
4. `pip install -U -e .`&#x20;

Once the package installation finishes, you should be able to invoke:

* `tevmc --help`

### Initialization

`tevmc` uses a specific self-contained directory structure for each individual node, to create a new node directory from template use the `init` sub command.

* `tevmc init {node name}`

There are three templates available:

* `local`: Local development testnet
* `testnet`: Standard testnet node
* `mainnet`: Standard mainnet node

If your node name contains any of this names the corresponding template will be selected. Examples:

* `tevmc init local-dev-1  # will use local template`
* `tevmc init us-testnet-04  # will use testnet template`
* `tevmc init rpc.mainnet-07  # will use mainnet template`

### Configuration

Inside the directory created by the `init` command you'll see a `docker` directory and the unified config file `tevmc.json`.&#x20;

From the newly created node directory run:

> `tevmc build --headless`

The first time you build the images `tevmc` will populate all the different config files in the `docker` directory based of the values in the unified config file. After that it will only re-create the files from templates if it detects changes on `tevmc.json`.

### Bootstrap

With the docker images built we can launch the node:

> `tevmc up  # launch daemon on the background`&#x20;
>
> `tevmc up && tevmc wait-init  # launch and stream output until ready` &#x20;

You should eventually see `control point reached!` in the logs, at that point the full node stack should be up and ready to serve requests.

### Where is the data?

The idea is to create self contained node directories, which can be easily moved with the stack down.

Each sub-directory inside main docker path generally contains a combination of this directories:

* `build` docker build context
* `config` editable configuration files, mounted to were they are needed inside the respective container.
* `data` permanent storage kept between runs
* `logs` log file location

#### Full directory structure

```
node/
├── docker/
│   ├── beats/
│   ├── elasticsearch/
│   ├── eosio/
│   ├── hyperion/
│   ├── kibana/
│   ├── rabbitmq/
│   └── redis/
└── tevmc.json
```

### Monitoring

You can stream logs from any container using the `stream` sub command:

> `tevmc stream {source}`

Available sources:

* `daemon`&#x20;
* `redis`
* `rabbitmq`
* `beats`
* `elasticsearch`
* `kibana`
* `eosio`
* `hyperion-indexer`
* `hyperion-api`

### Landing

To bring the stack down run:

> `tevmc down`

This will perform graceful `nodeos` stop and bring down all containers.

### FAQ

#### Can I use this to process and index both native & EVM transactions?

> Yes, but will need to set correct producer keys on `nodeos` and un-whitelist `eosio.evm` on Hyperion config.

#### As  soon as I launch the stack it crashes with an error like this one:

```
07:00:32:WARNING:Starting daemon.
07:00:32:INFO:opening redis-2122399...
07:00:33:INFO:running
07:00:33:INFO:
07:00:33:INFO:*** FATAL CONFIG FILE ERROR (Redis 6.2.6) ***
07:00:33:INFO:Reading the configuration file, at line 92
07:00:33:INFO:>>> 'port $redis_port'
07:00:33:INFO:argument couldn't be parsed into an integer
07:00:33:CRITICAL:container status: removing, log dump:
07:00:33:CRITICAL:couldn't access logs.
07:00:33:WARNING:Stopping daemon.
```

> This error usually happens when trying to launch a stack without previously running `tevmc build` first.

#### While in the process of launching the `nodeos` service, it crashes with an error like this one:

```
14:40:34:INFO:error 2022-02-09T14:40:34.566 nodeos    main.cpp:163                  main                 ] 3110006 plugin_config_exception: Incorrect plugin configuration
14:40:34:INFO:Genesis state is necessary to initialize fresh blockchain 
state but genesis state could not be found in the blocks log. Please either
load from snapshot or find a blocks log that starts from genesis.
```

> Usually means `nodeos` data is corrupted due to an ungraceful stop.

#### Can I start indexing from a custom snapshot?

> Yes set the `snapshot` config on `nodeos` section and also `start_on` on Hyperion section.

#### Stack is correctly launched but when running transactions I get an error like this one on `hyperion-api` logs:

```

#### Is `kubernetes` supported?

> No
