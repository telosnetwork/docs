# Creating an EVM address in Telos Wallet

To get started on the EVM, you'll need to create a Telos account and have TLOS in the account. Instructions for creating and funding a Telos account can be found in the [Wallets & Accounts](../../users/wallets.md) section.&#x20;

You can skip this step by [using a web3 wallet such as MetaMask](creating-an-evm-address-in-telos-wallet.md#connecting-metamask), Trust Wallet etc and [depositing your TLOS from an exchange](deposit-withdraw-and-send-tlos.md).

## Creating a tEVM address

A tEVM address links your native Telos account to a newly generated EVM address. This address is unique to your Telos account. TLOS on the tEVM can be deposited and withdrawn from this tEVM address.

Once you've got a Telos account, creating a tEVM address is simple.

1. Go to the Telos [web-wallet](https://wallet.telos.net) and log in with your Telos account.
2. Click on the "**Generate EVM address**" button.&#x20;

3\. You should now see your unique EVM address linked to your Telos account.

4\. Alternatively, you can deposit to the EVM, and it will automatically generate a new address with the first deposit. This process is covered in more details in the [next section](deposit-withdraw-and-send-tlos.md).

## Connecting Metamask

Telos EVM fully supports [Metamask](https://metamask.io), a leading wallet for Ethereum based blockchains. In order to interact with the tEVM using Metamask, you need to add the network to Metamask.&#x20;

The most convenient way to do this is via [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org), which curates a list of EVM networks. The Telos EVM mainnet and testnet are listed on Chainlist with ChainIDs 40 and 41, respectively. To add a chain to Metamask, connect your wallet and press the "Add To Metamask" button.

Now you are setup and ready to deposit, withdraw or send TLOS!
