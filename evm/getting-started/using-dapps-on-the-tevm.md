# Using dapps on the tEVM

Interacting with dapps on the tEVM is the same as with other Ethereum-based network (Ethereum, BSC). Simply go to the dapp, connect your wallet using Metamask and sign the transactions as you normally would.

In this section we'll use a token swapping dapp running on the Telos testnet EVM. This guide assumes that you have already created and setup a tEVM account which is already funded with TLOS, and connected to the tEVM.&#x20;

If you have not created and funded your tEVM account, please refer back to the previous sections.

## Example: Token Swapping dapp (testnet)

To start swapping tokens on the tEVM testnet, you can go to the following website.

1. Go to the site and connect your wallet. (Anchor, Metamask or wallet connect). In this example we are signed in with Anchor (which uses tEVM address linked to your native Telos account).

2\. Select the tokens you want to swap. In this case TLOS to CAKE tokens.

3\. Once you have specified the amounts, click on the "**Swap**" button. Sign the transaction and you're done! You have successfully swapped your tokens.
