# Comparing Telos to other EVM chains

Telos is a Delegated Proof of Stake \(DPoS\) blockchain based on the source code  originally from the EOS blockchain. 

### Age 

Telos has been operating for three years without interruption. 

| Blockchain | Continuously operating since |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ethereum | 2015 |
| Telos | 2019 |
| Binance Smart Chain | 2020 |
| Polygon | 2021 |

### Decentralisation

Telos is a fair distribution chain. The original TLOS token distribution was made as wide as possible to ensure that Telos blockchain stays conflict-free and community-led effort. More information about fair distribution model \[TODO add links\]

Top 10 accounts own % of tokens

| Blockchain | Number of all tokens % |

| Telos |  |
| Ethereum |  |
| Polygon |  |
| Binance smart chain |  |

\* Note that BNB and MATIC token distribution does not consider bridging.

### Block production and validators

Telos is based on Delegated Proof of Stake model. There are X active block products at the the time. There are total X block producers. The block producers are cycled as Y.

### Governance

Telos has an on-chain governance. Telos token holders can vote on proposals through SQRL wallet. There are XXX passed proposals. The most important proposal that passed was YYY.

### Conflict of interest and regulatory choke points

As explained in the decentralisation paragraph above, Telos is highly free of conflict of interest due to wide token distribution. This makes it a good candidate for co-operation among large and small cryptocurrency ecosystem actors. Furthermore, centralisation increases regulatory risk and risk of founders giving up on the project.

| Blockchain | Conflict of interest issues |
| :--- | :--- |
| Telos | No conflict |
| Ethereum | No conflict, except if you have your own chain \(Binance\) |
| Binance Smart Chain | Conflict of interest for any centralised exchange to integrate with |
| Polygon | Highly centralised and depends on the Polygon founders |



### Frontrunning protection

Frontrunning is a situation where miners or bots trade against your transaction causing monetary loss to you. Especially miners on Ethereum mainnet are suspectible for this. This may cause millions of dollars of losses for decentralised application users. 

Telos has binding rules for block producers. Any block producer that is caught manipulation can be blacklisted through on-chain governance. The fast block speed makes it less likely anyone can frontrun transactions in a public mempool.

| Blockchain | Frontrunning situation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ethereum | Very bad |
| Telos | Prevented through governance |
| Binance Smart Chain | Can be frontrun |
| Polygon | Can be frontrun |
| Secret Network | Prevented through private transactions |
