# About Ethereum virtual machine

Telos EVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine running on a Telos blockchain.

This section is mainly intended for developers who are working with Solidity and want to bring their smart contracts to run on Telos. 

Due to the popularity of Ethereum, EVM and its programming languages Solidity and Vyper are the dominant smart contract execution and development environments. Making it easy to bring existing Solidity applications to Telos makes it easier for developers to adopt Telos blockchain. Developers will benefit from the advanced features for Telos, like fair distribution, fast block times and cost-efficient transactions,
