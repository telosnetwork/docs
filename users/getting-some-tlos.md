# Setting up a wallet

TLOS token is both the governance and resource token of the Telos network and is used for voting on network wide governance ballots, managing transaction quota and purchasing RAM.  Currently, the easiest ways of obtaining TLOS tokens are the following:

## Mainnet

  * Full list of Exchange Markets available on [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/telos#markets)\

* [Worker Proposal System](https://medium.com/telos-foundation/telos-user-guide-tutorial-worker-proposals-b9b5f422ef08): the TLOS blockchain designates a fixed amount of TLOS tokens per month to be awarded to work proposals that receive enough votes. This feature gives projects that would otherwise have difficulty raising funds through traditional avenues the ability to persuade TLOS voters that their project is worthy of financial support by the community. Types of projects that have received funding in the past include event, DApps, core TLOS development, marketing efforts, charity, wallet development, education initiatives, and many others.

* **Contribute**: there are plenty of projects and organizations that are looking for help, and many of them are willing to offer some compensation. Visit some of the TLOS related Telegram channels and ask around!
