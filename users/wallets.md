# Wallets & Accounts

When interacting with the Telos blockchain, your choice of wallet software for safely storing and utilizing your tokens is one of the most critical decisions that you can make. Important factors include security, usability, and integrations for DApps and trading.

Currently, some of the more commonly used wallets are the following \(_**note that this is not an endorsement of any of the following wallets**_**\)**

### **Desktop**

* [SQRL](https://sqrlwallet.io/): wallet with support for staking and voting
  * [Telos account creation with SQRL](https://trybe.one/how-to-create-and-open-a-telos-account-using-sqrl/)
* [Scatter](https://get-scatter.com/): wallet with support for multiple EOS sister chains
  * [Telos account creation with Scatter](https://trybe.one/how-to-setup-your-telos-wallet-using-scatter-so-you-can-change-your-owner-keys/)

### **Mobile**

* TBD

### Command-Line

* [CLEOS](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/cleos/index): developed by [Block.One](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/cleos/index)

Creating a Telos account typically requires a small deposit of another cryptocurrency, and should be finalized shortly after payment. From this point forward your account name can be used as your receiving address, and will be used to identify you on the blockchain.
