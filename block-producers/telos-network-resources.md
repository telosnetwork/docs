# Telos Network Resources

Block producers are responsible for providing the network resources required for the Telos blockchain network to function. Just like any application needs resources to run, on Telos it is also the case. The resources required to run Telos are CPU, NET and RAM.

CPU is used to describe processing power, measured in microseconds. If a dApp has a lot of complex transactions, it needs more CPU to process transactions. CPU determines how much time a block producer will dedicate to processing a transaction. This needs to be quick, since each block producer is required to produce a new block every 0.5 seconds.

NET is also referred to as network bandwidth measured in bytes. If a dApp handles a lot of transactions, it would require more net.

CPU and NET are obtained through staking TLOS tokens. Staking is the process of locking up crypto for a period of time. Telos rewards people who stake their tokens by giving them access to network resources. Staking is free. The more tokens a dApp or user of the network stakes, the more resources are provided. As network traffic increases more tokens can be staked, If it declines, then tokens can be withdrawn.

Last but not least of the Telos network resources are RAM. RAM (also referred to as data storage cap) is measured in kilobytes. The more on-chain storage an application needs, the more RAM it needs to acquire. RAM is acquired through purchasing and not through staking like CPU and NET. RAM stores all the information considering an account (state) â€“ ownership, keys, balances, etc.

In simple terms, CPU, NET and RAM are required to make the best use of the blockchain. On Telos, these resources are cheap and for a normal user, it is advisable to stake 0.1-0.5 TLOS each to CPU and NET and buy 0.5-1 TLOS worth of RAM, which is more than sufficient for a really long time in most cases.
