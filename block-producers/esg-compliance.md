# ESG Compliance

From its inception, Telos has been committed to the principles of ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance). As part of the program, Telos is seeking to attract developers who are passionate about addressing current ESG challenges.

Telos is the most energy efficient blockchain today thanks to the Telos Core Devs team making sure every single bit of resource is used as efficiently as possible. They aim to have each line of their code as optimized as possible and hence requiring as little hardware as possible to run.

Telos is the greenest blockchain network, boasting of an energy consumption rate of 1814 kWh/day, compared to other blockchain networks like Ethereum which consumes 67 685 kWh/day and Visaâ€™s 563 165 kWh/day.
