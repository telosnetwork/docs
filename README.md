# Welcome to Telos

### About

Telos is a public blockchain running on the EOSIO software. It is based on the EOS software originally produced by Block One, but uses a modified genesis block where initial account balances were fairly distributed. 

### Main blockchain features

* Delegated proof-of-stake consensus
* [EOS compatibility](developers/platform/overview/)
* [EVM compatibility](evm/about-ethereum-virtual-machine.md)
* 0.5 second block time

### Advanced features and governance

* * [Telos Decide](developers/telos_contracts/telos-decide/), **on chain governance voting system**
* On-chain **node operator standards** 
* **Worker Proposal System:** An inflation-supported system that would provide for continued enhancement of the network
* **An inverse-weighted voting protocol** designed to discourage collusion and increase participation
* **IPFS** \(Telos Interplanetary File System\)
* **Resources administration** program
* Working **ratify and amend contract** for stakeholders
