# Welcome to Telos!

Telos blockchain network is a third-generation public blockchain solution for decentralized projects and applications, which addresses three issues pertaining to wide scale blockchain adoption and implementation:

1. Scalability (number of transactions per second),&#x20;
2. Affordability (cost per transactions / running of dApps), and&#x20;
3. Fair governance.&#x20;

Telos is built on EOSIO technology, which is an open-source blockchain software protocol that provides developers and entrepreneurs with a platform on which to build, deploy and run high-performing blockchain applications.

Since Telos is built on EOSIO, Telos inherits large parts of functionality of the protocol it was founded on (with our own major improvements implemented).

**Telos provides:**&#x20;

1. Unique resource model allowing low to no fee transactions.&#x20;
2. Highly scalable infrastructure with up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS).&#x20;
3. dApp developer-friendly platform with low cost deployment.

The incredible performance capabilities and cost basis of Telos makes our blockchain the perfect home of Telos Ethereum Virtual Machine (tEVM). The tEVM was built from the ground up, designed specifically to address the issue of scalability, affordability and fair governance of Ethereum based dApps, that suffered significantly from the massive increases of transaction cost.

The ability to encapsulate Ethereum based transactions at lightning fast speed and extremely low cost, makes it unique in the industry. This enables Telos to run native dApps and smart contracts, but also grants access to the large market of Ethereum-based dApps.

Therefore, Telos is a highly scalable third-generation layer 1 smart contract platform supporting both Solidity (on [tEVM](https://www.telos.net/evm)) and fee-less native C++ smart contracts. Without any code modifications, Ethereum projects can simply replicate their dApps and deploy to tEVM using familiar tool sets including MetaMask, Hardhat, Truffle, Remix, ethers.js and others.

All the applications from different EOSIO-based blockchains are interoperable and make them cross-chain compatible by default. Telos provides a blockchain protocol which is high speed, flexible, and secure. Since Telos adopted and expanded on the codebase provided by EOSIO, Telosâ€™ blockchain network also inherits the qualities provided by EOSIO.

Telos is highly valuable for blockchain developers since it provides a platform for&#x20;

* Upgradable smart contracts,&#x20;
* Scheduled transactions,&#x20;
* Pre-built libraries, and&#x20;
* Familiar developer tools.&#x20;

Telos enables developers to upgrade their smart contracts without requiring them to upload new ones. This enables Telos to run schedules and recurring transactions (which can enable subscription based payments) and much more.

## Main Telos blockchain features

What if you had it all? With Telos you get:

* A [delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS)](developers/platform/protocol/consensus\_protocol.md#3.-eosio-consensus-dpos-+-abft) consensus mechanism.
* [EOSIO compatibility](developers/platform/overview/) and [EVM compatibility](evm/getting-started/introduction-to-tevm.md).
* A Fast and scalable architecture - [10,000 TPS with 0.5 second block time](https://www.telos.net/evm#speed-scalability).
* [No Gas fees](https://www.telos.net/evm#micro-transactions) - No gas fees on Native and insignificant fees on EVM to keep spammers away.
* [No front-running](https://www.telos.net/evm#Frontrunning-Outrun) - First in, first out transactions functionally eliminate front running)
* A truly decentralized blockchain solution - Our Block Producers are located around the world and cannot be owned by the same entity.
* [Community governed blockchain](https://www.telos.net/governance) - Using our Governance Engine our community decides on everything from proposals to board.
* [Eco-friendly blockchain solution](https://www.telos.net/esg-blockchain).

## Advanced features and governance

Telos offers a wide array of other advances features.

* [Telos Decide](developers/telos\_contracts/telos-decide/), **on chain governance voting system**
* On-chain **node operator standards**&#x20;
* ****[**Worker Proposal System**](developers/blockchain-characteristics.md)**:** An inflation-supported system that would provide for continued enhancement of the network
* **An inverse-weighted voting protocol** designed to discourage collusion and increase participation
* **IPFS** (Telos Interplanetary File System)
