# Tutorials

We believe that the best way to learn how to build a DApp on the Telos blockchain is to be guided step-by-step to build something tangible that can be observed by other users. For that reason we are going to start off with a minimal interaction with the Telos blockchain, followed by building a simple to-do list application.

### Create a testnet account, repeat this process as much as you need for development purposes

1. Generate keys either using `cleos` command line wallet or another tool \([api.telos.net](https://api.telos.net/v1/docs/index.html#/accounts/get_v1_keys) is another option\)
2. Use the [Testnet Faucet](https://app.telos.net/testnet/developers) to create an account and get some testnet TLOS
3. Import those keys into your wallet of choice, and write them down somewhere you will not lose them!
