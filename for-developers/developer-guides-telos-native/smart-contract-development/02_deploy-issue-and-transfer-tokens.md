# Deploy, Issue & Transfer Tokens

## Step 1: Obtain Contract Source

Navigate to your contracts directory.

```text
cd CONTRACTS_DIR
```

Pull the source

```text
git clone https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.contracts --branch v1.7.0 --single-branch
```

This repository contains several contracts, but it's the `eosio.token` contract that is important for this section. Navigate to the `eosio.contracts/contracts/eosio.token` directory.

```text
cd eosio.contracts/contracts/eosio.token
```

## Step 2: Create Account for Contract

Before we can deploy the token contract we must create an account to deploy it to, we'll use the **eosio development key** for this account.

You need to unlock your wallet prior to the next step

```text
cleos create account eosio eosio.token EOS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV
```

## Step 3: Compile the Contract

```text
eosio-cpp -I include -o eosio.token.wasm src/eosio.token.cpp --abigen
```

## Step 4: Deploy the Token Contract

```text
cleos set contract eosio.token CONTRACTS_DIR/eosio.contracts/contracts/eosio.token --abi eosio.token.abi -p eosio.token@active
```

```

## Step 5: Create the Token

To create a new token, call `create` action with the correct parameters. This action accepts 1 argument, it consists of:

* An issuer that is an eosio account. In this case, it's `alice`. This issuer will be the one with the authority to call `issue` and/or perform other actions such as closing accounts or retiring tokens.
* An `asset` type composed of two pieces of data, a floating-point number sets the maximum supply and a `symbol` in capitalized alpha characters which represents the asset. For example, "1.0000 SYS".

Below is a concise way to call this method, using positional arguments:

```text
cleos push action eosio.token create '[ "alice", "1000000000.0000 SYS"]' -p eosio.token@active
```

The command above created a new token `SYS` with a precision of 4 decimals and a maximum supply of 1000000000.0000 SYS. It also designates `alice` as the issuer. To create this token, the contract requires the permission of the `eosio.token` account. For this reason, `-p eosio.token@active` was passed to authorize this action.

An alternate approach uses named arguments:

```text
cleos push action eosio.token create '{"issuer":"alice", "maximum_supply":"1000000000.0000 SYS"}' -p eosio.token@active
```

Execute the command above:

```text
executed transaction: 10cfe1f7e522ed743dec39d83285963333f19d15c5d7f0c120b7db652689a997  120 bytes  1864 us
#   eosio.token <= eosio.token::create          {"issuer":"alice","maximum_supply":"1000000000.0000 SYS"}
warning: transaction executed locally, but may not be confirmed by the network yet         ]
```

## Step 6: Issue Tokens

The issuer `alice` can now issue new tokens. As mentioned earlier only the issuer can do so, therefore, `-p alice@active` must be provided to authorize the `issue` action.

```text
cleos push action eosio.token issue '[ "alice", "100.0000 SYS", "memo" ]' -p alice@active
```

```text
executed transaction: d1466bb28eb63a9328d92ddddc660461a16c405dffc500ce4a75a10aa173347a  128 bytes  205 us
#   eosio.token <= eosio.token::issue           {"to":"alice","quantity":"100.0000 SYS","memo":"memo"}
warning: transaction executed locally, but may not be confirmed by the network yet         ]
```

This time the output contains several actions: one `issue` action and three `transfer` actions. While the only action signed was `issue`, the `issue` action performed an `inline transfer` and the `inline transfer` notified the sender and receiver accounts. The output indicates all the action handlers that were called, the order they were called in, and whether any output was generated by the action.

Technically, the `eosio.token` contract could have skipped the `inline transfer` and opted to just modify the balances directly. However, in this case the `eosio.token` contract is following a token convention that requires that all account balances be derivable by the sum of the transfer actions that reference them. It also requires that the sender and receiver of funds be notified so they can automate handling deposits and withdrawals.

To inspect the transaction, try using the `-d -j` options, which indicate "don't broadcast" and "return the transaction as json", which you may find useful during development.

```text
cleos push action eosio.token issue '["alice", "100.0000 SYS", "memo"]' -p alice@active -d -j
```

## Step 7: Transfer Tokens

Now that account `alice` has been issued tokens, transfer some of them to account `bob`.

```text
cleos push action eosio.token transfer '[ "alice", "bob", "25.0000 SYS", "m" ]' -p alice@active
```

```text
executed transaction: 800835f28659d405748f4ac0ec9e327335eae579a0d8e8ef6330e78c9ee1b67c  128 bytes  1073 us
#   eosio.token <= eosio.token::transfer        {"from":"alice","to":"bob","quantity":"25.0000 SYS","memo":"m"}
#         alice <= eosio.token::transfer        {"from":"alice","to":"bob","quantity":"25.0000 SYS","memo":"m"}
#           bob <= eosio.token::transfer        {"from":"alice","to":"bob","quantity":"25.0000 SYS","memo":"m"}
warning: transaction executed locally, but may not be confirmed by the network yet         ]
```

Now check if `bob` received the tokens using [cleos get currency balance](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/cleos/command-reference/get/currency-balance)

```text
cleos get currency balance eosio.token bob SYS
```

```text
25.0000 SYS
```

Check `alice`'s balance. Notice that tokens were deducted from the account.

```text
cleos get currency balance eosio.token alice SYS
```

```text
75.0000 SYS
```

Excellent! Everything adds up.
