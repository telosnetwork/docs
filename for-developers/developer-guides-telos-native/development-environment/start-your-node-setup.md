# Start keosd and nodeos

## NOTE - You can skip this step and use the Telos testnet instead of a local testnet

## Step 1: Boot Node and Wallet

### Step 1.1: Start keosd

First let us start keosd:

```text
keosd &
```

You should see some output that looks like this:

```text
info  2018-11-26T06:54:24.789 thread-0  wallet_plugin.cpp:42          plugin_initialize    ] initializing wallet plugin
info  2018-11-26T06:54:24.795 thread-0  http_plugin.cpp:554           add_handler          ] add api url: /v1/keosd/stop
info  2018-11-26T06:54:24.796 thread-0  wallet_api_plugin.cpp:73      plugin_startup       ] starting wallet_api_plugin
info  2018-11-26T06:54:24.796 thread-0  http_plugin.cpp:554           add_handler          ] add api url: /v1/wallet/create
info  2018-11-26T06:54:24.796 thread-0  http_plugin.cpp:554           add_handler          ] add api url: /v1/wallet/create_key
info  2018-11-26T06:54:24.796 thread-0  http_plugin.cpp:554           add_handler          ] add api url: /v1/wallet/get_public_keys
```

Press enter to continue

### Step 1.2: Start nodeos

Start nodeos now:

```text
nodeos -e -p eosio \
--plugin eosio::producer_plugin \
--plugin eosio::producer_api_plugin \
--plugin eosio::chain_api_plugin \
--plugin eosio::http_plugin \
--plugin eosio::history_plugin \
--plugin eosio::history_api_plugin \
--filter-on="*" \
--access-control-allow-origin='*' \
--contracts-console \
--http-validate-host=false \
--verbose-http-errors >> nodeos.log 2>&1 &
```

These settings accomplish the following:

1. Run **Nodeos. This** command loads all the basic plugins, set the server address, enable CORS and add some contract debugging and logging.
2. Enable CORS with no restrictions \(\*\) and development logging

\[\[warning\]\] \| In the above configuration, CORS is enabled for `*` **for development purposes only**, you should **never** enable CORS for `*` on a node that is publicly accessible!

### Troubleshooting

If in the previous step, after starting `nodeos`, you see an error message similar to "Database dirty flag set \(likely due to unclean shutdown\): replay required" try to start `nodeos` with `--replay-blockchain`. More details on troubleshooting `nodeos` can be found [here](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/nodeos/troubleshooting/index).

## Step 2: Check the installation

### Step 2.1: Check that Nodeos is Producing Blocks

Run the following command

```text
tail -f nodeos.log
```

You should see some output in the console that looks like this:

```

Press `ctrl + c` to close the log

### Step 2.2: Check the Wallet

Open the shell and run the cleos command to list available wallets. We will talk more about wallets in the future. For now, we need to validate the installation and see that the command line client [cleos](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/cleos) is working as intended.

```text
cleos wallet list
```

You should see a response with an empty list of wallets:

```text
Wallets:
[]
```

From this point forward, you'll be executing commands from your local system \(Linux or Mac\)

### Step 2.3: Check Nodeos endpoints

This will check that the RPC API is working correctly, pick one.

1. Check the `get_info` endpoint provided by the `chain_api_plugin` in your browser: [http://localhost:8888/v1/chain/get\_info](http://localhost:8888/v1/chain/get_info)
2. Check the same thing, but in the console on your **host machine**

```text
curl http://localhost:8888/v1/chain/get_info
```
