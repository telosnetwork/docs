# Install the Contract Dev Toolkit

The EOSIO Contract Development Toolkit, CDT for short, is a collection of tools related to contract compilation. Subsequent tutorials use the CDT primarily for compiling contracts and generating ABIs.

Starting from 1.3.x, CDT supports Mac OS X brew, Linux Debian and RPM packages. The easiest option to install would be using one of these package systems. Pick one installation method only. \[\[warning\]\] \| If you have versions of eosio.cdt prior to 1.3.0 installed on your system, please uninstall before proceeding

## Homebrew \(Mac OS X\)

### Install

```text
brew tap eosio/eosio.cdt
brew install eosio.cdt
```

### Uninstall

```text
brew remove eosio.cdt
```

## Ubuntu \(Debian\)

### Install

```text
wget https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt/releases/download/v1.6.3/eosio.cdt_1.6.3-1-ubuntu-18.04_amd64.deb

sudo apt install ./eosio.cdt_1.6.3-1_amd64.deb
```

### Uninstall

```text
sudo apt remove eosio.cdt
```

## CentOS/Redhat \(RPM\)

### Install

```text
wget https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt/releases/download/v1.6.3/eosio.cdt-1.6.3-1.el7.x86_64.rpm

sudo yum install ./eosio.cdt-1.6.3-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
```

### Uninstall

```text
$ sudo yum remove eosio.cdt
```

## Install from Source

The location where `eosio.cdt` is cloned is not that important because you will be installing `eosio.cdt` as a local binary in later steps. For now, you can clone `eosio.cdt` to your "contracts" directory previously created, or really anywhere else on your local system you see fit.

```text
cd CONTRACTS_DIR
```

### Download

Clone version 1.6.3 of the `eosio.cdt` repository.

```text
git clone --recursive https://github.com/eosio/eosio.cdt --branch v1.6.3 --single-branch
cd eosio.cdt
```

It may take up to 30 minutes to clone the repository

\[\[success \| Virtual machine environment\]\] \| In case you are using a virtual machine. It should be configured with at least 2 CPUs \(does not have to be two physical ones\) and 8G of memory to avoid compilation errors

### Build

```text
./build.sh
```

#### Install

```text
sudo ./install.sh
```

The above command needs to be ran with `sudo` because `eosio.cdt`'s various binaries will be installed locally. You will be asked for your computer's account password.

Installing `eosio.cdt` will make the compiled binary global so it can be accessable anywhere. For this tutorial, **it is strongly suggested that you do not skip the install step for eosio.cdt**, failing to install will make it more difficult to follow this and other tutorials, and make usage in general more difficult.

## Troubleshooting

### Getting Errors during build.

* Search your errors for the string "/usr/local/include/eosiolib/"
* If found, `rm -fr /usr/local/include/eosiolib/` or navigate to `/usr/local/include/` and delete `eosiolib` using your operating system's file browser.
