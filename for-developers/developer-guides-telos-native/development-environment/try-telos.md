# Try Telos

If you do not want to install binaries on your local machine, or if you have other types of restrictions installing binaries, you can try Telos in a web browser at [Telos Studio](https://studio.telos.net). This is a great way to get started with learning how to write and deploy smart contracts directly to the Telos testnet or mainnet.

You can get a testnet account and testnet TLOS at the [faucet](https://app.telos.net/testnet/developers).

## Local development environment

* [Getting Started](prerequisites.md): Install the EOSIO platform in your local development environment.
