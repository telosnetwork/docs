# Developer guides: Telos EVM

EVM Smart Contracts are supported by the tEVM. These smart contracts work similarly to the Ethereum Virtual Machine's smart contracts written in Solidity and Vyper.

The following sections contain guidelines on how to start with smart contracts on Telos EMV.

2. [Developing & Deploying Smart Contracts for tEVM](getting-started.md)
3. [Verifying smart contract code](verifying-smart-contract-source-code.md)
