# Ballots

## Ballot Creation

To create a new ballot, call the `newballot()` action. Note that the account publishing the ballot must also be a member of the group they wish to publish the ballot under.

**Ballot Statuses**

Ballot statuses describe the current stage of a ballot's lifecycle. All new ballots begin with the `setup` status.

| Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| setup | Ballot is being drafted. |
| voting | Ballot is currently open for voting. |
| closed | Ballot is closed and final results have been rendered. |
| cancelled | Ballot was cancelled, awaiting deletion. |
| archived | Ballot is currently archived and can't be deleted. |

### Voting Methods

Voting Methods describe how a ballot will react to voters with different token balances. One method splits a voter's balance among all of their selections, and another casts their full balance on each selection, for example.

| Voting Method | Description | Raw Token Weight | Transformed Weight Per Selection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1acct1vote | Every voter gets 1 whole token vote, regardless of account balance. Zero balances don't count. | 0.01 TEST | 1.00 TEST Each |
| 1tokennvote | Raw token weight is applied to each option selected. | 3.00 TEST | 3.00 TEST Each |
| 1token1vote | Raw token weight is split among all selections. | 3.00 TEST | 1.00 TEST Each |
| 1tsquare1v | Raw weight is split among selections and each weight squared. At ballot closure each option's total will be square-rooted | 3.00 TEST | 9.00 TEST Each |
| quadratic | Raw weight is square-rooted and split among selections. | 3.00 TEST | 9.00 Each |

**Ballot Settings**

Ballots have a range of settings that further alter their behavior.

| Setting | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| lightballot | Marks as a light ballot. | false |
| revotable | Allows revoting on the ballot. | true |
| voteliquid | Considers voter's liquid balance into vote weight. | false |
| votestake | Considers voter's staked balance into vote weight. | The value of the Treasury's `stakeable` setting |

You cannot combine both `voteliquid` and `votestake` on the same ballot, you must choose one or the other.  If you choose both, `votestake` setting will be used.  
  
If the treasury has `stakeable` set to false, and `voteliquid` is also left set to false, the ballot cannot be voted on, as no accounts will have any vote weight.  This is especially important for the `VOTE` token \(which is a mirror of an account's staked `TLOS` balance\), any ballots using the `VOTE` token should use the `togglebal` action on `votestake` to set it to true, so the ballot can be votable \(this is typically handled by the tool being used, but is noted here for anyone building tools or contract integrations\).
