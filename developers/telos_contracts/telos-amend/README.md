# Telos Amend

### Getting Started

Telos Amend is a Decentralized Document Amendment service for the Telos Blockchain Network. It allows any Telos holder to create text documents or links and allow a group of decentralized voters to propose amendments.

#### Service Fees

| Fee Name     | Fee Amount   |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| New Document | 50.0000 TLOS |
| New Proposal | 10.0000 TLOS |

{% hint style="info" %}
The above fees are adjustable by a Block Producer multisig or a referendum by the Telos token holders.
{% endhint %}

### Deposit into Telos Amend

To make a deposit to cover service fees, simply transfer TLOS to the `amend.decide` account. Telos Amend will catch the transfer and automatically create a deposit balance, if one doesn't already exist. Further deposits and withdrawals will automatically flow from this deposit balance.

### Withdraw from Telos Amend

To make a withdrawal from Telos Amend, call the `withdraw` action on the `amend.decide` contract.
