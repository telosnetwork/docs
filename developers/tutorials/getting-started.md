description: Build Your Own Telos DApp

# Getting Started on Testnet

We believe that the best way to learn how to build a DApp on the Telos blockchain is to be guided step-by-step to build something tangible that can be observed by other users. For that reason we are going to start off with a minimal interaction with the Telos blockchain, followed by building a simple to-do list application.

### 1. Acquire Testnet TLOS

Hopefully you have already created a Telos account by now \(go to the Users -&gt; Wallets & Accounts section to find out how\). Since acquiring testnet TLOS is simple and free we are going to go that route within this tutorial. For your desktop wallet enable Telos testnet:

* [SQRL](https://sqrlwallet.io/): Tools -&gt; Wallet Tools -&gt; Blockchain Networks, and enable **Telos Testnet**

* Scatter: go to Administrative -&gt; Networks -&gt; Add custom network with chain ID of: e17615decaecd202a365f4c029f206eee98511979de8a5756317e2469f2289e3

To activate your Telos Testnet account, go to [this link](https://app.telos.net/testnet/developers), insert the account name that you want and a public \(owner\) key and active key. You have the option of using your public key for both fields \(it should be a long string of characters that start with "EOS..."\). After you have successfully submitted the form, give it a few minutes and then unlock the wallet \(in [SQRL](https://sqrlwallet.io/)\) or refresh your accounts \(in [Scatter](https://get-scatter.com/)\)

From that same [link](https://app.telos.net/testnet/developers) insert your new account's 12-character name and click the "SEND TESTNET TELOS" button. You should see your new account's balance reflect the received testnet TLOS tokens within a few seconds. Congrats, you now own some Testnet Telos tokens! These tokens are the primary resource for being able to interact with the Telos \(Testnet\) network.
