# Overview

Telos is built on the [EOSIO](https://eos.io) platform, and as a result the developer guides applicable to EOSIO, (authored by [BlockOne](https://block.one)) applies in this section.

If you do not want to install binaries on your local machine, or if you have other types of restrictions installing binaries, you can try Telos in a web browser at [Telos Studio](https://studio.telos.net).&#x20;

This is a great way to get started with learning how to write and deploy smart contracts directly to the Telos testnet or mainnet.
